## What 
I created a quiz that would statistically show how generic a student is compared to the average Dartmouth student. I looked at 
data such as statistics on breakdown of student graduates who work in certain industries, percentages of Dartmouth population studying
all of the different majors, how often Dartmouth students "go out" per week, and the percentage breakdown of the location Dartmouth students 
work after graduation. 

I assigned scores between 1-5 roughly on the percentages and then summed the scores to determine how generic someone would be. For example,
a 5 score would be given to the location that most Dartmouth students go after graduation. In another example, a 5 would be given to 
the career industries that most Dartmouth students work. 

## JSON 
I decided to go with the JSON part because it is completely new to me and I wanted to learn it. It works well

## What didn't work
I wasn't able to add as many design features as I would have liked 

## Screencap
