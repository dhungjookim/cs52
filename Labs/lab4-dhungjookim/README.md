## Description
A simple CRUD blog made with React + Redux. uses API server hosted on cs52-blog.herokuapp.com.

## What worked/didn't work
Was able to get everything to work. I would've liked to work on some extra credit but ran out of time. 
I was able to add material-ui styling and create a logo for the surge website.
